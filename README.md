This python code is a so-called Compound Interest Calculator.

In order to calculate the future value of an investment, assuming a certain rate of interest, the following
equation can be used: 

E=B(1+𝑟𝑓)𝑓𝑡

Where 

E is the future (ending) balance,
B is the beginning amount
r is the annual rate of interest (in decimal, e.g., 5% is .05)
f is the number of times the interest rate compounds (times per year)
t is the term of the investment (in years)

This program will ask the user to input the values for the variables above, perform the calculation, and display a result to the user of the form:
An initial investment of [B], in [t] years, at an interest rate of [r]%, compounded at [f] times per year, will be worth [E]. 

For example: An initial investment of 1000.0, in 3 years, at an interest rate of 5.0%, compounded at 1 times per year, will be worth 1157.6250000000002.
